## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Menus Activity – Laravel Blade Template System

This project was developed as part of **Activity 11**, where the objective is to understand and apply Laravel’s Blade template inheritance system.

## 🎯 Objective
Create a Laravel project with a primary view that contains a navigation menu and multiple secondary views that inherit from a main layout using Blade.

---

## 📌 Features Implemented

### ✔ Primary View (Layout)
A main layout (`main.blade.php`) containing:
- Navigation menu
- Blade `@yield()` section for each page
- Footer visible in all sections

### ✔ Secondary Views
Three pages were created:
- **Home**
- **Photos**
- **Contact**

Each has unique content to clearly identify the section.

### ✔ Active Menu Highlight
The menu automatically highlights the selected section using Blade logic:

```blade
class="{{ request()->is('photos') ? 'active' : '' }}"
